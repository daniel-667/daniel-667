## 🧭 Manual Remediation

### ✅ Step 1: Verify Current Configuration

1. Press `Win + R`, type `regedit`, and press Enter  
2. Navigate to:

    ```
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon
    ```

3. Look for the `SCRemoveOption` value

> **Note:** If the value is missing or not set to `1` or `2`, remediation is required.

---

### 🛠️ Step 2: Configure the Registry Setting

1. Right-click the `Winlogon` key → **New > String Value**
2. Name it: `SCRemoveOption`  
3. Double-click it and set the **Value data** to:
   - `1` – Lock Workstation  
   - `2` – Force Logoff

4. Click **OK**, then close the Registry Editor

---

### 🔁 Step 3: Verify the Change

1. Restart your system  
2. Log in using a smart card  
3. Remove the smart card  
4. Confirm:
   - System locks (if set to `1`)  
   - System logs off (if set to `2`)
