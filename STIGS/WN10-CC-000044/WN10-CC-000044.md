# STIG-ID Report: WN10-CC-000044 - Internet Connection Sharing Must Be Disabled

**STIG ID:** WN10-CC-000044  
**Severity:** Medium  

---

## Vulnerability Discussion

Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) allows a system to share its internet connection with other devices, typically functioning as a mobile hotspot. While this feature might seem useful in certain scenarios, it poses significant security risks. Specifically, ICS exposes the system to the possibility of being accessed by other devices, some of which may have malicious intent. This opens the door for potential attacks on the system sharing the connection, as any device connected to the shared network could exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

Disabling ICS is a critical security measure to prevent unauthorized access and to maintain a more secure network environment. If ICS is left enabled, it can allow devices with potentially unverified or untrusted access to communicate through the primary system's internet connection, increasing the risk of data breaches, malware infections, and network disruptions.

## Check

To verify compliance with the security requirement, you need to inspect the registry configuration as follows:

- **Registry Hive:** HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE  
- **Registry Path:** `\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Network Connections\`  
- **Value Name:** NC_ShowSharedAccessUI  
- **Value Type:** REG_DWORD  
- **Expected Value:** 0x00000000 (0)

If this registry value does not exist or is configured differently from the expected value (0x00000000), the system is in non-compliance, and this constitutes a finding.

---

## Fix

To mitigate the vulnerability and ensure ICS is disabled, the following steps must be taken:

1. **Group Policy Configuration:**
   - Open the **Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)**.
   - Navigate to **Computer Configuration >> Administrative Templates >> Network >> Network Connections**.
   - Locate the policy **"Prohibit use of Internet Connection Sharing on your DNS domain network"**.
   - Set this policy to **"Enabled"**.

2. **Registry Configuration (alternative method):**
   - Navigate to the **Registry Editor** (`regedit`).
   - Go to the path **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Network Connections**.
   - Ensure that the registry value **NC_ShowSharedAccessUI** is set to **0x00000000** (0).

This configuration will disable the ability for users to enable ICS and will prevent the system from acting as a hotspot for other devices.

## Automation Solution

To automate the resolution of this STIG requirement, you can use the following PowerShell script. This script checks if the registry path and value are correctly configured to disable Internet Connection Sharing (ICS). If the path or value does not exist or is misconfigured, it will automatically create and configure it as needed.

### PowerShell Script

```powershell
# Define the registry path and value
$registryPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Network Connections"
$valueName = "NC_ShowSharedAccessUI"
$desiredValue = 0

# Check if the registry path exists
if (-not (Test-Path $registryPath)) {
    # Create the registry path if it doesn't exist
    New-Item -Path $registryPath -Force
}

# Get the current value of the registry key
$currentValue = Get-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $valueName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Check if the value exists and if it is set to the desired value
if ($currentValue -eq $null -or $currentValue.$valueName -ne $desiredValue) {
    # Set the registry value to disable Internet Connection Sharing
    Set-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $valueName -Value $desiredValue
    Write-Host "Internet Connection Sharing has been disabled."
} else {
    Write-Host "Internet Connection Sharing is already disabled."
}
```

### Script Explanation:

- **Registry Path and Value:** The script defines the registry path (`HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Network Connections`) and the value name (`NC_ShowSharedAccessUI`), which controls Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) functionality.
  
- **Path Check:** It checks whether the registry path exists. If not, the script creates the path.

- **Value Check and Update:** The script checks if the registry value exists and is set to the desired value (`0`). If it is not, the script updates the value to `0`, disabling ICS.

- **Output:** After the check and update, the script will display a message indicating whether ICS has been disabled or if it was already disabled.

## Conclusion

Disabling Internet Connection Sharing is an important step in securing Windows-based systems and preventing unauthorized access. By ensuring the specified registry values are configured correctly or using Group Policy to prohibit ICS, organizations can reduce the attack surface and enhance the overall security posture of their networked systems.

For automation, the provided PowerShell script can be used to quickly and reliably configure the registry to disable ICS across multiple systems, ensuring compliance with the STIG requirement.
