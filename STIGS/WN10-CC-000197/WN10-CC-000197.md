## 🛠️ Manual Remediation Through Registry Editor for WN10-CC-000197

### ✅ **Step 1: Check Current Registry Setting**

1. Press `Win + R` to open the **Run** dialog.
2. Type `regedit` and hit **Enter** to open the **Registry Editor**.

3. Navigate to the following path: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\CloudContent`

4. **Verify the `CloudContent` Key**:
- If the `CloudContent` key does **not exist**, you will need to create it.
- If the key is **present**, move on to step 2.

**To create the `CloudContent` key**:
1. Right-click on the **Windows** key in the left pane.
2. Select **New → Key**.
3. Name the new key **`CloudContent`**.

5. **Look for the `DisableWindowsConsumerFeatures` value**:
- If **missing** or **incorrect**, proceed to the next step.
- If the value **exists** but is set incorrectly, update it to the required value.

---

### 🛠️ **Step 2: Add or Update the Registry Value**

1. **Right-click on the `CloudContent` key**.
2. Select **New → DWORD (32-bit) Value**.
3. Name the new value **`DisableWindowsConsumerFeatures`**.

4. **Set the value**:
- Double-click on **`DisableWindowsConsumerFeatures`**.
- In the **Value data** field, enter `1` (this will disable Microsoft consumer experiences).
- Click **OK** to save the setting.

5. Close the **Registry Editor**.

## 🛠️ Manual Remediation Through Group Policy Editor

To resolve the issue, the organization should configure the policy to turn off Microsoft consumer experiences. This can be done by setting the Group Policy value for the setting:

- **Path**: `Computer Configuration >> Administrative Templates >> Windows Components >> Cloud Content`
- **Setting**: "Turn off Microsoft consumer experiences" should be set to **Enabled**.

When this setting is enabled, Microsoft consumer experiences will be disabled, preventing suggestions and automatic installations of apps from the Windows Store. This ensures more control over what is installed on the system.

---

## ⚙️ Automated Remediation (PowerShell)

### 💡 Step 1: Run the Script

```powershell
# Define the registry path and value name
$registryPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\CloudContent"
$valueName = "DisableWindowsConsumerFeatures"

# Check if the registry path exists, if not, create it
if (-not (Test-Path $registryPath)) {
    New-Item -Path $registryPath -Force
}

# Set the registry value to disable Microsoft consumer experiences
Set-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $valueName -Value 1 -Type DWord

# Confirm that the setting has been applied
$settingValue = Get-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $valueName
if ($settingValue.DisableWindowsConsumerFeatures -eq 1) {
    Write-Host "Successfully disabled Microsoft consumer experiences." -ForegroundColor Green
} else {
    Write-Host "Failed to disable Microsoft consumer experiences." -ForegroundColor Red
}
```
---

## 🔁 Reboot & Confirm

- **Reboot the system**
- Verify that Microsoft consumer experiences are disabled and no unsolicited apps are installed.

---

## 🔍 Post-Remediation: Validate Compliance

### 🧪 Vulnerability Scan

1. Use your scanning tool (e.g., Tenable) to validate the STIG:
   - Open the scan results.
   - Search for the relevant finding.
   - Verify that compliance is marked as **PASSED**.
