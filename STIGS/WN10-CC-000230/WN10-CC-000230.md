# üõ°Ô∏è Remediation Guide: STIG ID WN10-CC-000230

## üéØ Objective

This **Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG)** ensures that users **cannot bypass or ignore Windows Defender SmartScreen warnings** when browsing the web using **Microsoft Edge**, specifically preventing users from ignoring warnings about potentially **malicious websites**.

---

## üí• Vulnerability Discussion

The **Windows Defender SmartScreen filter** in **Microsoft Edge** provides warnings when users attempt to visit potentially dangerous websites or download files that could be malicious. If users are allowed to ignore these warnings, they could unintentionally access harmful websites or download malicious files, potentially leading to **security breaches** or **malware infections**.

Allowing users to bypass or dismiss SmartScreen warnings undermines the **security feature**, exposing the system to threats. This STIG ensures that users are forced to heed these warnings, enhancing overall system security.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Applicability

- This STIG applies to **unclassified systems**.
- For **Windows 10 LTSC (Long-Term Servicing Channel) B versions**, which do not include **Microsoft Edge**, this STIG is **not applicable**.

---

## üìù Check Method

To verify compliance, check the following registry setting:

1. **Registry Path**:  
   `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\MicrosoftEdge\PhishingFilter\`

2. **Registry Value Name**:  
   `PreventOverride`

3. **Value Type**:  
   **REG_DWORD**

4. **Required Value Setting**:  
   `0x00000001` (which equals `1` in decimal)

If this registry value does **not exist** or is not configured as specified, it is considered a **finding**, indicating non-compliance with the STIG.

## üõ†Ô∏è Remediation

### **Group Policy Configuration:**

To ensure users cannot bypass SmartScreen warnings, configure the following policy:

1. **Path**:  
   `Computer Configuration` ‚Üí `Administrative Templates` ‚Üí `Windows Components` ‚Üí `Microsoft Edge`
   
2. **Policy Name**:  
   `"Prevent bypassing Windows Defender SmartScreen prompts for sites"`

3. **Setting**:  
   Set this policy to **Enabled**.

Alternatively, configure this policy in another location:

2. **Alternate Path**:  
   `Computer Configuration` ‚Üí `Administrative Templates` ‚Üí `Windows Components` ‚Üí `Windows Defender SmartScreen` ‚Üí `Microsoft Edge`

This setting will prevent users from bypassing **SmartScreen prompts** for malicious websites.

Additionally, you can configure the required registry setting directly.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è PowerShell Script for Remediation

For automation, use this **PowerShell script** to configure the registry and prevent users from bypassing SmartScreen warnings:

```powershell
# Define the registry path and value name
$registryPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\MicrosoftEdge\PhishingFilter"
$valueName = "PreventOverride"

# Check if the registry path exists, if not, create it
if (-not (Test-Path $registryPath)) {
    New-Item -Path $registryPath -Force
}

# Set the registry value to prevent overriding SmartScreen warnings
Set-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $valueName -Value 1 -Type DWord

# Confirm that the setting has been applied
$settingValue = Get-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $valueName
if ($settingValue.PreventOverride -eq 1) {
    Write-Host "Successfully configured Microsoft Edge to prevent bypassing SmartScreen prompts." -ForegroundColor Green
} else {
    Write-Host "Failed to configure Microsoft Edge to prevent bypassing SmartScreen prompts." -ForegroundColor Red
}
```

## üèÅ Conclusion

Disabling the ability for users to bypass **Windows Defender SmartScreen** prompts for malicious websites in **Microsoft Edge** enhances security by ensuring users cannot visit harmful websites or download dangerous files. The STIG emphasizes the importance of enforcing this setting to maintain a secure browsing experience and prevent exposure to online threats.

By following the provided remediation steps or using the PowerShell script, organizations can configure their systems to meet the requirements and mitigate the associated risks.
