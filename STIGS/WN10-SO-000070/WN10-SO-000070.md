# 🔐 STIG Remediation Guide: WN10-SO-000070  
_Set Machine Inactivity Limit to 15 Minutes on Windows 10_

---

## 📘 Overview

This guide explains how to manually and automatically remediate **STIG ID: WN10-SO-000070**, which requires enforcing a **15-minute machine inactivity limit** that triggers the **screensaver lock**. This helps protect against unauthorized access during idle sessions.

## 🔍 STIG Summary

| **STIG ID** | **WN10-SO-000070** |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **Requirement** | Machine inactivity must trigger lock after 15 minutes |
| **Default State** | May be unset or exceed 15 minutes |
| **Remediation** | Set registry value `InactivityTimeoutSecs = 900` |
| **Rationale** | Reduces risk of unauthorized access if the system is left unattended |

## 📝 Manual Remediation

### 🔧 Step 1: Check Current Setting

1. Press `Win + R`, type `regedit`, and hit Enter.  
2. Navigate to: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System`
3. Look for the value `InactivityTimeoutSecs`.  
- If it's missing or greater than `900`, proceed with remediation.

### ✍️ Step 2: Create or Edit the Registry Value

1. Right-click the `System` key → `New > DWORD (32-bit) Value`  
2. Name the value: `InactivityTimeoutSecs`
