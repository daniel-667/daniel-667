# ‚úÖ STIG Compliance: WN10-AU-000500 ‚Äì Windows Event Log Size

## üß™ Initial Assessment

I initiated a **Tenable compliance scan** on a Windows 10 VM using valid credentials and the **Windows Compliance Checks** plugin.  
The scan revealed **137 failed items**, one of which was:

> **STIG ID**: `WN10-AU-000500`  
> **Requirement**: The **Application event log's maximum size** must be set to **32768 KB** or greater.

## üîç Researching the Fix

A quick search led me to [stigaview.com](https://stigaview.com), where I confirmed the solution:

- **Option 1**: Set the policy via **Group Policy Editor**
- **Option 2**: Modify the registry value:
    - Path: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\Application`
    - Value Name: `MaxSize`
    - Type: `DWORD`
    - Value: `32768 (decimal)`

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Fix Implementation

When I opened **Registry Editor**, I noticed the required key structure was missing.

### üß© Registry Creation Steps:
1. Navigate to: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\`
2. Manually create the **Application** subkey.
3. Inside it, create a **DWORD (32-bit)** value named `MaxSize`.
4. Set its value to **32768 (decimal)**.
