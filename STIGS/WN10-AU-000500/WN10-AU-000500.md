## STIG Compliance for Windows Event Log

I began by running a **Tenable scan** with the **Windows Compliance Checks** plugin on a target VM using provided credentials, identifying 137 failed items. I focused on **STIG ID WN10-AU-000500**, which requires the **Application event log’s maximum size** to be set to **32768 KB** or greater.

### Identifying the Fix
A Google search led me to [stigaview.com](https://stigaview.com), where I found the fix: configure the **Maximum Log Size (KB)** policy in **Group Policy** or update the `MaxSize` registry value.

## No Registry Value

### Manual Configuration
I manually implemented the fix by opening **Registry Editor** and navigating to:
Noticing the **EventLog** key was missing, I created it, added an **Application** subkey, and within it, created a **DWORD** value named `MaxSize` set to **32768** (decimal).

After restarting the VM, a follow-up scan confirmed that the STIG passed.

### Validation
To validate, I removed the registry fix, rescanned the system (which resulted in a failure), and then explored automation.

### Automation with PowerShell

Using **ChatGPT**, I generated a **PowerShell script** to replicate the registry changes. I tested the script in PowerShell, applied it, and rescanned the system—the STIG passed again, confirming the automated fix worked as intended.

## Script Successful!

### Conclusion
This process addressed **WN10-AU-000500** efficiently, blending **manual configuration** with a **scalable, script-based solution**.
