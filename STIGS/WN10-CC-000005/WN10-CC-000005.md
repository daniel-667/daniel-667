# üîí STIG Compliance: WN10-CC-000005 ‚Äì Disable Lock Screen Camera Access

## üß™ Initial Assessment

I began by running a **Tenable compliance scan** on a Windows 10 VM using valid credentials and the **Windows Compliance Checks** plugin.

> **STIG ID**: `WN10-CC-000005`  
> **Requirement**: **Disable camera access from the lock screen** to prevent unauthorized use.

Allowing camera access before login could be exploited for unauthorized activity. This STIG ensures only logged-in, authorized users can access camera functionality.

## üîç Researching the Fix

Referencing [stigaview.com](https://stigaview.com), I found two compliant methods to apply the fix:

### üõ†Ô∏è Option 1: Group Policy

Enable the following policy if a camera is present:
### Path to Setting

- **Computer Configuration**
  - Administrative Templates
    - Control Panel
      - Personalization
        - Prevent enabling lock screen camera

Set the policy to: `Enabled`

### üõ†Ô∏è Option 2: Registry Editor

Alternatively, configure the following registry value:

- **Path**:  `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Personalization`
- **Value Name**: `NoLockScreenCamera`  
- **Type**: `REG_DWORD`  
- **Value**: `1`

> üí° *Devices without a camera are exempt from this requirement.*

## üß© Manual Fix Implementation

I applied the fix manually using the **Registry Editor**:

1. Open `regedit`
2. Navigate to: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Personalization`
3. Create a new `DWORD (32-bit)` value:
- Name: `NoLockScreenCamera`
- Value: `1`

After restarting the VM, I performed another scan using Tenable.  
‚úÖ **The STIG passed successfully!**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Automated Fix with PowerShell

To streamline the process for future systems, I created a **PowerShell script** that replicates the registry modification.

### üß† Script Logic:
- Checks for and creates the key path if it doesn't exist
- Adds or updates `NoLockScreenCamera` to `1`

After executing the script, I reran the Tenable scan.  
‚úÖ The STIG passed once again!

## üß© Conclusion

This exercise demonstrates a successful remediation of **STIG ID WN10-CC-000005** using both **manual registry editing** and a **repeatable PowerShell-based automation** approach.

This method ensures compliance with federal security standards and improves endpoint security posture by preventing unauthorized camera access before login.
