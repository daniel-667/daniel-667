## Tenable Scan and Fix for STIG ID WN10-CC-000005  

I began by running a **Tenable scan** using the **Windows Compliance Checks** plugin on a target VM with the provided credentials. I focused on **STIG ID WN10-CC-000005**, which requires disabling camera access from the lock screen to prevent unauthorized use. Allowing camera access from the lock screen could enable unauthorized access, while requiring a logon ensures that only authorized personnel can use the device.  

### Fix Methods  
According to the fix from **stigaview.com**, the configuration must be applied through either **Group Policy** or the **Registry Editor**.  

#### **Group Policy Configuration**  
If a camera is present, you should enable the **"Prevent enabling lock screen camera"** policy under:  
Computer Configuration → Administrative Templates → Control Panel → Personalization


#### **Registry Editor Configuration**  
Alternatively, you can modify the registry value:
NoLockScreenCamera (REG_DWORD = 1)

under:  
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Personalization


Devices without a camera are exempt from this requirement.

### Manual Fix  
I first applied the fix manually by adding the registry value:  
NoLockScreenCamera (REG_DWORD = 1)

under:  

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Personalization

using the Registry Editor. After applying the manual fix, I conducted another scan to confirm it was successful.

### Automated Fix with PowerShell  
After verifying the manual fix, I reverted the changes and proceeded to automate the fix using a **PowerShell script**.

The script modified the Registry Editor to add the registry value:  
NoLockScreenCamera (REG_DWORD = 1)

under:  

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Personalization

## Script Successful!

After running the script, I performed a final scan to verify the fix, and it worked successfully.
