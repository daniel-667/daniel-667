## Manual Configuration

1. **Tenable Scan**: Initially, I ran a Tenable scan using the **Windows Compliance Checks** plugin on a target VM, identifying 137 failed items. Among them, the **WN10-AU-000500** was flagged.

2. **Manual Fix**: 
   - I identified that the **Application Event Log** maximum size was not configured correctly. According to the STIG, this value should be **32768 KB** or greater.
   - After researching on **stigaview.com**, I implemented the fix manually:
     1. Opened the **Registry Editor**.
     2. Navigated to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows`.
     3. Created the missing **EventLog** key, and then the **Application** subkey.
     4. Created a **DWORD** value named `MaxSize` and set it to **32768** (decimal).
     5. Restarted the VM and performed a follow-up Tenable scan to confirm that the STIG was now passed.
