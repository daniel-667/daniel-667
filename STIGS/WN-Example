# Windows Security Configuration Automation - STIG Compliance

## Overview

This project demonstrates how I implemented a fix for the STIG ID **WN10-AU-000500**, which mandates that the **Application Event Log's maximum size** be set to **32768 KB** or greater. 

### Manual Configuration

1. **Tenable Scan**: Initially, I ran a Tenable scan using the **Windows Compliance Checks** plugin on a target VM, identifying 137 failed items. Among them, the **WN10-AU-000500** was flagged.
   
2. **Manual Fix**: 
   - I identified that the **Application Event Log** maximum size was not configured correctly. According to the STIG, this value should be **32768 KB** or greater.
   - After researching on **stigaview.com**, I implemented the fix manually:
     1. Opened the **Registry Editor**.
     2. Navigated to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows`.
     3. Created the missing **EventLog** key, and then the **Application** subkey.
     4. Created a **DWORD** value named `MaxSize` and set it to `32768` (decimal).
     5. Restarted the VM and performed a follow-up Tenable scan to confirm that the STIG was now passed.

### Automation with PowerShell

After manually fixing the issue, I explored automating the process using PowerShell to replicate the registry changes.

1. **PowerShell Script**: Using ChatGPT, I generated a PowerShell script to automate the registry modifications.
2. **Testing the Script**:
   - I ran the PowerShell script in **PowerShell**.
   - I performed a scan, and it confirmed that the STIG passed successfully.

### Validation

To validate the fix:
1. I removed the registry modification and rescanned, which resulted in the STIG failing.
2. I then reapplied the PowerShell script, and the STIG passed again, confirming that the automated solution worked as intended.

### Conclusion

This project blends **manual configuration** with a **scalable, script-based solution**, ensuring that the system adheres to security best practices while being efficient and automatable.
